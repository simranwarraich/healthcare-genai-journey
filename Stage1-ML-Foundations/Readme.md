Stage 1: ML & DL Foundation (2–3 months)
	• Course: Andrew Ng’s ML Specialization + Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera).
	• Mini-Assets I’ll build:
✅ Simple ML models (predict claim approval, churn prediction on insurance data).
✅ A basic neural network for text classification (classify claim notes as approved/denied).
	• Time: 6–8 hrs/week → ~12 weeks.
⚡ By the end, I’ll have 2 GitHub projects + blog/LinkedIn post.
